It's like a RF-Node but it's called a 'Tode'.

#Project Status
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Initial design pictured may be changed abruptly.  The project is still in its
design state.  Firmware is not functional at this time;  PCB design files and
3D-Prints are available but no complete build instructions yet.  The PCB set is 
currently limited to a single IO Wing and only the Ebyte E3-433T30D has correct 
Back-Plane PCB design.

Please check back later for an available release.
